# Rocket Commerce

Minimal E-Commerce site built using MERN Stack.

## Getting Started

Get Rocket Commerce up and running on your local machine. 

### Prerequisites

You will need to have node and npm to run this project: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Clone the repository onto your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/ajmorash/rocket-commerce.git
```

Change directory to rockect-commerce and install dependencies

```
cd rocket-commerce
npm install
```

Change directory to the front end client and install dependencies

```
cd client
npm install
```

Change directory back to top level directory and start both the server and the client

```
cd ..
npm run dev
```

This will run the server with a connection to my MongoDB Atlas instance. If you want to change the database you can add your own MongoDB connection string in config/default.json
